## Description
> Let X be a set. The a topology, T, on a set X is a collection of subsets of X that adheres to the following three conditions:
> 1. X and the empty set are elements of T
> 2. T is closed under finite intersections
> 3. T is closed under unions
>    
> This program allows users to create a collection of subsets, T, of a given set X and determine if T is a topology on X. The set X can have 1 - 5 elements; its size is determined by the user.
